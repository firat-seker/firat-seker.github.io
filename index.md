I am a PhD student in psychology studying morality in the form of values and behavior across time and different cultural contexts. 
I'm mainly interested in how religion influences morality and how their interplay changes throughout time and places, but my research interests are varied. Check out the research page for more details and for some current projects!

Alongside my academic work, I write stuff and make music. Check out the writing page!
