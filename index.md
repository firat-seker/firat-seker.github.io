I am a Ph.D. student in social psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I mainly study morality in the form of values and behavior throughout history and across different cultural contexts. 
I'm specifically interested in how religion influences morality and how their interplay changes throughout time and places, but my research interests encompass different topics that revolve around human morality. Check out the [Research page](/research/) for more details!

Alongside my academic work, I write stuff and make music. Check out the [Writing page](/writing/)!
