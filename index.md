I am a PhD student in psychology studying morality in the form of values and behavior across time and different cultural contexts. 
Specifically, I'm interested in how religion influences morality and how the interplay between religion and morality changes throughout time in repsonse to major historical events.

Alongside my academic work, I write essays and fiction.
