## About My Writing

My non-academic (and more fun) writing includes both fiction and science communication. I am interested in writing novels, short stories, and comics.

I currently have popular science articles published on **Medium**, where I communicate scientific advancements on topics that interest me. 
These articles are currently available only in **Turkish**. In the future, I aim to write new articles in English.

## Fiction (In Progress)

I am currently working primarily on a fantasy novel, as well as several short stories.
While these works are not yet published, writing fiction is a central part of my creative life. I finished my first novel at the age of 12.
