## Research
My research mainly revolves around morality and cooperation. I explore the **why** behind the endorsement of different moral values and how these values change over historical periods and cultural contexts.
More specifically, I'm interested in how macro-level factors, such as ecology and institutions, influence moral values and behaviors. Religion is another central interest of mine, as it plays a key role in how moral values are shaped and manifested.
I use various methods, from computational methods to experimentation, to answer my research questions.
