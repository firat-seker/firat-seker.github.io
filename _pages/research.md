My research mainly revolves around morality and cooperation. I explore **why** individuals endorse different moral values and how these values change over historical periods and cultural contexts.
More specifically, I'm interested in how macro-level factors, such as ecology and institutions, influence moral values and behaviors. Religion is another central interest of mine, as it plays a key role in how moral values are shaped and manifested.
I use various methods, from computational to experimentation, to answer my research questions. See my [CV](/cv/) for my publications and in progress papers. 

## Research Concentration

### Ecological and Institutional Determinants of Morality

Ecologies and institutions are two macro-factors that shape human psychology. I am interested in how ecological factors, (e.g., pathogen prevalence, population density, resource scarcity) and institutions (e.g., historical exposure to institutionalized cultural rules) influence moral values and behaviors. 

### Religion, Morality, and Cooperation

It is argued that religion played an important role in the emergence of large scale societies and that religious belief fosters cooperation. I investigate the link between religion and cooperation from a historical psychological lens, studying whether it was stable throughout history or not.

### Cognitive Style and Morality

Cognitive style reveals a lot about how people process information and react to the world around them. I'm interested in how individuals who rely more on deeper thinking differ from those who rely on intuition in moral decision-making and whether some moral values are more "core" than others.
